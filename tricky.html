    An 85-year-old man goes to see his doctor for his regular physical exam. The
    doctor says that the man needs to provide a sperm sample and gives him a jar
    saying, "Take this jar home with you and come back tomorrow with a sperm
    sample."
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day the old man goes back to the doctors and gives him the jar,
    which is as clean and empty as when the doctor gave it to him. So the doctor
    asks what happened and why there is no sperm sample in the jar. The old man
    says, "Well, doc, it's like this... first I tried with my right hand, but
    nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my
    wife for help. She tried with her right hand - nothing; then with her left,
    still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with
    her teeth out, still nothing. We even called up Maisie, the lady next door
    and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried
    squeezing it between her knees, but still nothing."
  </p>
  <p>
    The doctor is really shocked by all this and asks incredulously, "You asked
    your neighbor???"
  </p>
  <p>The old man replies, "Yep, not one of us could get the jar open."</p>
