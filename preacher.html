    A couple were going on a vacation together but the wife had an emergency at
    work. So they agreed the husband would go as planned and his wife would meet
    him at the hotel the next day.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the husband got to his hotel and had checked in, he thought he should
    send his wife a quick email letting her know he'd got there ok.
  </p>
  <p>
    As he typed in her email address, he made a typo and his email was sent to
    an elderly preacherâ€™s wife whose instead. It just so happened that her
    husband had sadly died just the day before.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the grieving old preacher's wife checked her emails, she read the one
    from the holiday maker, let out an awful, loud, piercing scream, and fainted
    on the floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the sound of her falling, her family rushed into the room. They tended to
    her and then looked at her computer and saw this email on her screen:
  </p>
  <p><i>Dearest Wife,</i></p>
  <p>
    <i
      >Just checked in to my room. Everything is prepared for your arrival
      tomorrow.</i
    >
  </p>
  <p><i>P.S. It sure is hot down here.</i></p>
