    Late one night this guy is speeding down the empty road. A cop sees him go
    flying past so chases him and pulls him over. The cop goes up to the car and
    when the man rolls down the window, he asks, "Are you aware of how fast you
    were going, sir?"
  </p>
  <p>
    The man replies, "Yes I am. I'm trying to escape a robbery I got involved
    in."
  </p>
  <p>
    The cop looks at him disbelievingly and asks him, "Were you the one being
    robbed, sir?"
  </p>
  <p>
    The man casually replies, "Oh no, I was the one who committed the robbery. I
    was escaping."
  </p>
  <p>
    The cop is shocked and surprised that the man has admitted this so freely.
    He says, "So you're telling me you were speeding...AND committed a robbery?"
  </p>
  <p>"Oh yes," replies the man calmly. "I have all the loot in the back."</p>
  <p>
    The cop is now starting to get angry and says, "Sir, I'm afraid you have to
    come with me" as he reaches into the window to take the car keys out of the
    ignition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The man shouts, "Don't do that! I'm afraid that you'll find the gun in my
    glove compartment!" At this the cop pulls his hand out of the window and
    says, "Wait here" as he returns to his car and calls for backup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon there are cars, cops and helicopters all over, everywhere you look. The
    man is quickly dragged out of his car, handcuffed and taken towards a cop
    car. However, just before he is put in the car and taken away a cop walks up
    to him and says, while pointing at the cop that pulled him over, "Sir, this
    officer tells us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the
    trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. However,
    we didn't find any of these things in your car."
  </p>
  <p>The man replies, "Yeah, and I bet that liar said I was speeding too!"</p>
